# GitHub Projects v2 - ACTUAL Fix (Token Scope Correction)

## Issue Report #3 - REAL Root Cause Found ‚úÖ

### Critical Discovery

**The `project` scope is for CLASSIC Projects (v1), NOT Projects v2!**

For **Projects v2** (the new GitHub Projects), you need:
- ‚úÖ `read:org` scope (for organization projects)
- ‚úÖ SSO authorization (if org enforces SAML SSO)
- ‚ùå NOT the `project` scope (that's for legacy classic projects)

### Why This Was Confusing

**Misleading scope name:**
- Scope called "`project`" ‚Üí Sounds like it's for Projects
- But it's actually **only for classic Projects (v1)**
- Projects v2 requires `read:org` instead

**User had the WRONG scope:**
- ‚úÖ Had `project` scope (screenshot confirmed)
- ‚ùå But needed `read:org` scope for Projects v2
- This is why the API returned `null` silently

### The Real Solution

**Check if you have `read:org` scope:**

Looking at your screenshot, I can only see:
- ‚úÖ `project` (checked)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `read:project` (unchecked - this is also for classic projects)

**But I need to know: Do you have `read:org` checked further down in the scope list?**

### How to Fix (Correct Instructions)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Edit your token**
3. **Scroll down and find `read:org`**
4. **Check these scopes:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ repo
   ‚úÖ read:org  ‚Üê THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED!
   ‚ö†Ô∏è project (optional, only for classic projects)
   ```
5. **Click "Configure SSO"** and **authorize for "Gullers-Grupp"**
6. **Update token** and copy it
7. **Update VS Code settings**
8. **Restart VS Code**

### What I Fixed in the Code (v3)

Enhanced the error message to:
1. **List ALL Projects v2** the token can see
2. **Detect if token can't see ANY projects** ‚Üí Permission issue
3. **Clarify `read:org` is needed**, not just `project`
4. **Show available projects** so you can verify access

**New diagnostic output:**
```
‚ùå Project #1 not found for Gullers-Grupp

The organization "Gullers-Grupp" exists.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Your token cannot see ANY Projects v2 for "Gullers-Grupp".

**For Projects v2 (new GitHub Projects), you need:**
- ‚úÖ `read:org` scope (for organization projects)
- ‚úÖ Token must be SSO-authorized if org enforces SAML SSO

‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE: The `project` scope is for **classic Projects** (v1), NOT Projects v2!

**To fix this:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find your "knowing-mcp" token
3. Ensure these scopes are selected:
   ‚úÖ repo
   ‚úÖ read:org (REQUIRED for Projects v2!)
   ‚úÖ project (optional, only for classic projects)
4. Click "Configure SSO" and authorize for "Gullers-Grupp"
5. Update the token in VS Code settings
6. Restart VS Code
```

**Or if you DO have access:**
```
‚úÖ Your token CAN see Projects v2 for this org!

**Available Projects v2:**
- #1: Maconomy BI
  https://github.com/orgs/Gullers-Grupp/projects/1
- #2: Another Project
  https://github.com/orgs/Gullers-Grupp/projects/2

**Issue:** Project #99 is not in this list.

**Possible reasons:**
- Wrong project number (double-check the URL)
- Project was deleted or moved
- You don't have access to this specific project
```

### Why Expert AI Was Right (But I Misunderstood)

**Expert said:**
> "PAT classic missing the project scope... The project scope is not used for Projects v2 access."

I initially misread this as "you need the project scope" but the expert was actually saying:
- ‚ùå The `project` scope is NOT for Projects v2
- ‚úÖ You need `read:org` instead

**Second diagnosis confirmed:**
> "PAT classic: ensure it has at least read:org. The project scope is not used for Projects v2 access."

This is crystal clear now!

### Action Required From You

**Please check your GitHub token settings:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click on your knowing-mcp token
3. **Scroll through ALL the scopes**
4. **Look for `read:org` section** (it's separate from `project`)
5. **Is `read:org` checked?** ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the actual requirement

**Screenshot needed:**
Can you share a screenshot showing the **`read:org`** scope area? 
(It should be in a section called "admin:org" or similar)

### GitHub's Confusing Scope Naming

| Scope | What it's ACTUALLY for |
|-------|------------------------|
| `project` | Classic Projects (v1) - Legacy |
| `read:project` | Read classic Projects (v1) |
| `read:org` | **Organization access (INCLUDES Projects v2!)** ‚úÖ |
| Fine-grained ‚Üí Projects | Modern alternative for v2 |

The confusion is that:
- **Scope named "project"** ‚Üí Sounds like it should work for Projects
- **But it doesn't!** ‚Üí Only for old classic Projects
- **Actual requirement:** ‚Üí `read:org` scope

### Test After Fix

Once you've enabled `read:org` and restarted VS Code:

```javascript
mcp_knowing-mcp_project-get({
  owner: "Gullers-Grupp",
  number: 1
})
```

**Expected output (if read:org is enabled):**
```
üìã Project: Maconomy BI
Owner: Gullers-Grupp (organization)
ID: PVT_kwDO...
URL: https://github.com/orgs/Gullers-Grupp/projects/1
```

**Or helpful diagnostic:**
```
‚úÖ Your token CAN see Projects v2 for this org!

**Available Projects v2:**
- #1: Maconomy BI
  https://github.com/orgs/Gullers-Grupp/projects/1
```

### Files Updated

1. **`src/server.mjs`** - Enhanced diagnostics showing ALL visible projects
2. **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-PROJECTS.md`** - Corrected scope requirements
3. **`FIX-PROJECT-GET-V3-FINAL.md`** - This document

### Apologies

I apologize for the confusion with my previous responses. The issue is:
- ‚úÖ GitHub's naming is confusing (`project` ‚â† Projects v2)
- ‚úÖ Expert AI was correct (I misread the first response)
- ‚úÖ Your screenshot showed `project` checked (which led me astray)
- ‚ùå But we need to check `read:org` scope status

Please verify the `read:org` scope and SSO authorization!

---

**Next Step:** Check if `read:org` is enabled on your token, and if your org uses SSO, make sure the token is authorized for "Gullers-Grupp".
